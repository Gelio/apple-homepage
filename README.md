# Apple's homepage copy #

My attempt to recreate [Apple's homepage](http://www.apple.com/).

This is [a task](http://www.theodinproject.com/html5-and-css3/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients) from [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/).


## TODO ##
* make footer's site map responsive (sliding uls)
* push final version to GitHub
* add my project to TheOdinProject's page
